# Monitor

VEF includes a monitor service and a built-in resource for runtime inspection.

## Module Outputs

The monitor module provides:

| Output | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `monitor.Service` | runtime monitoring service |
| `sys/monitor` | built-in RPC resource |

The service is initialized and closed through lifecycle hooks when needed.

## `monitor.Service` Interface

The public monitoring service exposes:

| Method | Return type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Overview(ctx)` | `(*monitor.SystemOverview, error)` | combined overview snapshot |
| `CPU(ctx)` | `(*monitor.CPUInfo, error)` | CPU detail and usage |
| `Memory(ctx)` | `(*monitor.MemoryInfo, error)` | virtual and swap memory detail |
| `Disk(ctx)` | `(*monitor.DiskInfo, error)` | partitions and disk I/O detail |
| `Network(ctx)` | `(*monitor.NetworkInfo, error)` | interfaces and network I/O detail |
| `Host(ctx)` | `(*monitor.HostInfo, error)` | static host metadata |
| `Process(ctx)` | `(*monitor.ProcessInfo, error)` | current process detail |
| `Load(ctx)` | `(*monitor.LoadInfo, error)` | load averages |
| `BuildInfo()` | `*monitor.BuildInfo` | build metadata (no error) |

## Built-In Resource

The monitor module registers the `sys/monitor` RPC resource, mounted under
`/api` with the standard envelope (`resource`, `action`, `version`,
`params`, `meta`). No operation is public and none declares a dedicated
permission token: every action inherits the API engine's default Bearer
authentication.

Every action sets a custom per-operation rate limit of `Max: 60`. The window
length is not overridden, so it inherits `vef.api.rate_limit.period`
(default `5m`); the limiter counts per operation + client IP + principal,
in process memory on each node.

None of the actions define framework-level input parameters: `params` is
ignored and may be omitted entirely.

| Action | Access | Rate limit | Input | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `get_overview` | Bearer auth | `Max: 60` | none | `monitor.SystemOverview` |
| `get_cpu` | Bearer auth | `Max: 60` | none | `monitor.CPUInfo` |
| `get_memory` | Bearer auth | `Max: 60` | none | `monitor.MemoryInfo` |
| `get_disk` | Bearer auth | `Max: 60` | none | `monitor.DiskInfo` |
| `get_network` | Bearer auth | `Max: 60` | none | `monitor.NetworkInfo` |
| `get_host` | Bearer auth | `Max: 60` | none | `monitor.HostInfo` |
| `get_process` | Bearer auth | `Max: 60` | none | `monitor.ProcessInfo` |
| `get_load` | Bearer auth | `Max: 60` | none | `monitor.LoadInfo` |
| `get_build_info` | Bearer auth | `Max: 60` | none | `monitor.BuildInfo` |
| `get_event_streams` | Bearer auth | `Max: 60` | none | `monitor.EventStreamsInfo` |
| `get_integration_stats` | Bearer auth | `Max: 60` | none | `monitor.IntegrationStatsInfo` |

Behavior visible in source:

- `get_overview` is best-effort and never fails as a whole: a sub-probe that
  errors is logged and its overview field is left `null`, so one broken
  collector does not mask the rest.
- `get_cpu` and `get_process` are served from the background sample cache and
  return the monitor-not-ready business error (`monitor.ErrNotReady`) until
  the first sample lands.
- `get_memory`, `get_disk`, `get_network`, `get_host`, and `get_load` read
  live probes; a probe failure maps to `monitor.ErrCollectionFailed`.
- `get_build_info` cannot fail: the service always holds a non-nil build-info
  object (see [Build Info Behavior](#build-info-behavior)).
- `get_event_streams` is gated by the optional `event.StreamInspector`
  dependency. A nil inspector (the redis_stream transport is off) still
  returns `200 OK` with `enabled: false` and an empty `streams` list instead
  of failing; an inspector read error maps to `monitor.ErrCollectionFailed`.
- `get_integration_stats` mirrors the same degradation over the optional
  `integration.StatsInspector` (nil when the integration module is off):
  `enabled: false` with an empty `stats` list. Reading the in-memory snapshot
  itself cannot fail.
- business errors ride the standard result envelope: the HTTP status stays
  `200` and the failure is carried by the body `code`.

## Error API

| API | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `monitor.ErrNotReady` / `ErrCodeNotReady` (`2100`) | sample-backed data such as CPU or process metrics is not ready yet |
| `monitor.ErrCollectionFailed` / `ErrCodeCollectionFailed` (`2101`) | a monitor probe failed while collecting runtime data |

## Default Sampling Configuration

Defaults apply per unset field (a partial config only overrides the fields it sets):

| Setting | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `vef.monitor.sample_interval` | `10s` |
| `vef.monitor.sample_duration` | `2s` |

These settings drive the background sampler behind `get_cpu` and
`get_process`: a sample is taken immediately at startup and then once per
sample interval, and each sample measures utilization over one
sample-duration window. Until the first sample completes (roughly the first
window after startup), both actions answer with `monitor.ErrNotReady`.

## Build Info Behavior

The service constructor normalizes build info so that `vefVersion` is always present, even when the application does not provide a complete build metadata object.

Fallback behavior:

| Field | Fallback value when app does not supply build info |
| --- | --- |
| `appVersion` | `unknown` |
| `buildTime` | `unknown` |
| `gitCommit` | `unknown` |
| `vefVersion` | current framework version |

## Responses by Action

Field names below are the JSON wire names (the Go structs' json tags). Byte
quantities are plain byte counts, percentages range `0`–`100`, and counters
are cumulative since boot unless noted otherwise. Fields a platform does not
expose are reported as `0` or empty.

### `get_overview` — `monitor.SystemOverview`

One combined snapshot assembled from every probe. Each field is `null` when
its probe failed; `build` is always present.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | `*monitor.HostSummary` | condensed host information |
| `cpu` | `*monitor.CPUSummary` | condensed CPU information |
| `memory` | `*monitor.MemorySummary` | condensed memory usage |
| `disk` | `*monitor.DiskSummary` | condensed disk usage |
| `network` | `*monitor.NetworkSummary` | condensed network activity |
| `process` | `*monitor.ProcessSummary` | condensed current process metrics |
| `load` | `*monitor.LoadInfo` | load averages (same shape as `get_load`) |
| `build` | `*monitor.BuildInfo` | build metadata (same shape as `get_build_info`) |

#### `monitor.HostSummary`

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hostname` | `string` | host name |
| `os` | `string` | operating system |
| `platform` | `string` | platform name |
| `platformVersion` | `string` | platform version |
| `kernelVersion` | `string` | kernel version |
| `kernelArch` | `string` | kernel architecture |
| `uptime` | `uint64` | host uptime in seconds |

#### `monitor.CPUSummary`

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `physicalCores` | `int` | number of physical cores (host topology) |
| `logicalCores` | `int` | number of logical cores (host topology) |
| `usagePercent` | `float64` | aggregated CPU usage percent over the last sampling window, normalized by `effectiveCores` |
| `effectiveCores` | `float64` | the capacity used to normalize utilization: inside a container this is the cgroup CPU quota (v1 and v2 supported), falling back to `logicalCores` when constrained usage cannot be sampled coherently |

#### `monitor.MemorySummary`

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `total` | `uint64` | total memory in bytes |
| `used` | `uint64` | used memory in bytes |
| `usedPercent` | `float64` | memory usage percentage |

The monitor is container-aware: when the process runs under a
cgroup (v2 or v1) that actually limits memory, the headline figures (`total`,
`used`, `usedPercent`, and `VirtualMemory`'s available/free) reflect the
cgroup limit and the cgroup's own usage instead of host-wide numbers — a
512 MiB container on a 64 GiB host reports against 512 MiB. Without a limit,
host-wide figures are reported unchanged.

#### `monitor.DiskSummary`

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `total` | `uint64` | total size of the root filesystem in bytes |
| `used` | `uint64` | used size of the root filesystem in bytes |
| `usedPercent` | `float64` | root filesystem usage percentage |
| `partitions` | `int` | always `1` (the summary covers a single filesystem) |

The overview's disk summary reports **the filesystem that bounds
the process's root path** rather than summing every mounted partition — remote
mounts, disk images, and sibling volumes do not inflate host capacity, and
there is no `vef.monitor.excluded_mounts` config (nothing is summed, so
nothing needs excluding). The raw mount inventory remains available through
`DiskInfo.partitions`.

#### `monitor.NetworkSummary`

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `interfaces` | `int` | interface count |
| `bytesSent` | `uint64` | total bytes sent, summed across interfaces |
| `bytesRecv` | `uint64` | total bytes received, summed across interfaces |
| `packetsSent` | `uint64` | total packets sent, summed across interfaces |
| `packetsRecv` | `uint64` | total packets received, summed across interfaces |

#### `monitor.ProcessSummary`

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pid` | `int32` | process ID |
| `name` | `string` | process name |
| `cpuPercent` | `float64` | process CPU usage percent over the last sampling window; expressed against one CPU, so it can exceed `100` on multi-core hosts |
| `memoryPercent` | `float32` | share of total host RAM used by the process, percent |

### `get_cpu` — `monitor.CPUInfo`

Served from the background sample cache: refreshed once per sample interval
(default `10s`), each refresh measuring one sample-duration window (default
`2s`). Inventory fields (`modelName`, `vendorId`, `family`, `model`,
`stepping`, `microcode`, `mhz`, `cacheSize`) describe the first CPU package.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `physicalCores` | `int` | number of physical cores (host topology) |
| `logicalCores` | `int` | number of logical cores (host topology) |
| `modelName` | `string` | CPU model name |
| `mhz` | `float64` | nominal clock frequency in MHz |
| `cacheSize` | `int32` | cache size in KB |
| `usagePercent` | `[]float64` | per-core busy percentage over the sampling window, one entry per logical core; `null` inside a CPU-limited container (the cgroup measurement replaces the per-core sample) |
| `totalPercent` | `float64` | aggregate usage percent: the mean of the per-core sample, or — inside a CPU-limited container — the share of the cgroup capacity consumed over the window, capped at `100` |
| `vendorId` | `string` | vendor identifier |
| `family` | `string` | CPU family |
| `model` | `string` | CPU model |
| `stepping` | `int32` | CPU stepping |
| `microcode` | `string` | microcode version |
| `effectiveCores` | `float64` | capacity used to normalize utilization; see `CPUSummary.effectiveCores` |

### `get_memory` — `monitor.MemoryInfo`

under `MemorySummary` applies to `virtual` as well.

huge-page counters: `hugePagesTotal`, `hugePagesFree`, `hugePagesReserved`,
and `hugePagesSurplus` are page counts, while `hugePageSize` and
`anonHugePages` are bytes. Detail fields keep their host meaning even inside
a memory-limited container.
