# Events & Integration

## Event Publication

The approval module publishes its domain events through the framework's transactional outbox transport (see [Event Bus](../infrastructure/event-bus.md)). Every approval command writes the event record in the same transaction as the business mutation; the outbox relay then forwards them to the configured sink. Events produced within a single engine pass are published in occurrence order.

Subscribers must:

1. Attach with `event.WithGroup("...")` because the route resolves to an at-least-once transport.
2. Rely on the Inbox middleware for dedupe (it activates automatically when `event.middleware.inbox = true` and a transport advertises `AtLeastOnce`).

Events are published in the order they occur within a transaction. The engine emits
each event at the moment the corresponding state change happens, and the
outbox relay forwards them in that occurrence order.

Approval commands publish their domain events inside the business transaction
via `event.WithTx(db)`; the events become visible only if the transaction commits.
All approval domain events share the `approval.*` topic namespace.

> The standalone `apv_event_outbox` table and module-private `EventOutboxStatus` constants from earlier snapshots have been retired. Approval no longer carries a private outbox — it composes with the framework one.

### Domain Event Types

All approval events implement `DomainEvent`; `AllEventTypes()` is the exhaustive exported registry of their topic strings. Instance and task events embed `InstanceEventBase` (`instanceId`, `instanceNo`, `tenantId`, `title`, `flowId`, `flowCode`, optional `businessRef`, `applicant`, `occurredTime`). Task events additionally embed `TaskEventBase` (`taskId`, `nodeId`, `nodeName`). Flow events embed `FlowEventBase` (`flowId`, `tenantId`, `code`, `name`, `occurredTime`). The tables below list fields beyond those bases.

Instance lifecycle:

| Type constant | Topic | Payload / constructor | Payload fields beyond common fields | When |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `EventTypeInstanceCreated` | `approval.instance.created` | `InstanceCreatedEvent`, `NewInstanceCreatedEvent` | none | a new instance was started |
| `EventTypeInstanceCompleted` | `approval.instance.completed` | `InstanceCompletedEvent`, `NewInstanceCompletedEvent` | `finalStatus`, `finishedAt`, `reason` (set only when `finalStatus` is terminated) | instance reached a terminal status |
| `EventTypeInstanceWithdrawn` | `approval.instance.withdrawn` | `InstanceWithdrawnEvent`, `NewInstanceWithdrawnEvent` | `operator` (`UserInfo`), `reason` | applicant withdrew the instance |
| `EventTypeInstanceRolledBack` | `approval.instance.rolled_back` | `InstanceRolledBackEvent`, `NewInstanceRolledBackEvent` | `fromNodeId`, `fromNodeName`, `toNodeId`, `toNodeName`, `operator` (`UserInfo`), `opinion` | instance was rolled back to a previous node |
| `EventTypeInstanceReturned` | `approval.instance.returned` | `InstanceReturnedEvent`, `NewInstanceReturnedEvent` | `fromNodeId`, `fromNodeName`, `toNodeId`, `toNodeName`, `operator` (`UserInfo`), `opinion` | instance was returned to applicant |
| `EventTypeInstanceResubmitted` | `approval.instance.resubmitted` | `InstanceResubmittedEvent`, `NewInstanceResubmittedEvent` | `operator` (`UserInfo`) | returned or withdrawn instance was resubmitted |
| `EventTypeInstanceBindingFailed` | `approval.instance.binding_failed` | `InstanceBindingFailedEvent`, `NewInstanceBindingFailedEvent` | `trigger`, `status`, `businessTable`, `errorMessage` | an **eventual** business projection attempt failed after the desired state committed; the durable worker keeps retrying — this event is an operator notification, not the retry mechanism. Synchronous failures roll back the approval transaction and never emit it |

Node lifecycle:

| Type constant | Topic | Payload / constructor | Payload fields beyond common fields | When |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `EventTypeNodeAutoPassed` | `approval.node.auto_passed` | `NodeAutoPassedEvent`, `NewNodeAutoPassedEvent` | `nodeId`, `nodeName`, `reason` | a node auto-passed because of auto-pass execution, empty-assignee handling, or same-applicant handling |

Task lifecycle:

| Type constant | Topic | Payload / constructor | Payload fields beyond common fields | When |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `EventTypeTaskCreated` | `approval.task.created` | `TaskCreatedEvent`, `NewTaskCreatedEvent` | `assignee` (`UserInfo`), `deadline`, `status` | a task was created; sequential follow-up tasks may start with `deadline` omitted while waiting |
| `EventTypeTaskActivated` | `approval.task.activated` | `TaskActivatedEvent`, `NewTaskActivatedEvent` | `assignee` (`UserInfo`), `deadline`, `reason` (`assigned` / `queue_advanced` / `transferred` / `reassigned`) | a task became actionable (pending); emitted when the task is assigned, promoted from a queue, transferred, or reassigned. Suppressed when the task is cleared within the same engine pass (for example, a consecutive-approver cascade that creates and immediately resolves the task) |
| `EventTypeTaskApproved` | `approval.task.approved` | `TaskApprovedEvent`, `NewTaskApprovedEvent` | `operator` (`UserInfo`), `opinion` | task approved |
| `EventTypeTaskHandled` | `approval.task.handled` | `TaskHandledEvent`, `NewTaskHandledEvent` | `operator` (`UserInfo`), `opinion` | handle task completed |
| `EventTypeTaskRejected` | `approval.task.rejected` | `TaskRejectedEvent`, `NewTaskRejectedEvent` | `operator` (`UserInfo`), `opinion` | task rejected |
| `EventTypeTaskCanceled` | `approval.task.canceled` | `TaskCanceledEvent`, `NewTaskCanceledEvent` | `assignee` (`UserInfo`), `reason` | engine canceled a task that no longer needs a decision |
| `EventTypeTaskTransferred` | `approval.task.transferred` | `TaskTransferredEvent`, `NewTaskTransferredEvent` | `from` (`UserInfo`), `to` (`UserInfo`), `reason` | task transferred to another user |
| `EventTypeTaskReassigned` | `approval.task.reassigned` | `TaskReassignedEvent`, `NewTaskReassignedEvent` | `from` (`UserInfo`), `to` (`UserInfo`), `reason` | admin reassigned a task |
| `EventTypeTaskTimedOut` | `approval.task.timed_out` | `TaskTimedOutEvent`, `NewTaskTimedOutEvent` | `assignee` (`UserInfo`), `deadline` | timeout scanner fired the configured timeout action |
| `EventTypeAssigneesAdded` | `approval.task.assignees_added` | `AssigneesAddedEvent`, `NewAssigneesAddedEvent` | `addType`, `assignees` (`[]UserInfo`) | dynamic assignees added |
| `EventTypeAssigneesRemoved` | `approval.task.assignees_removed` | `AssigneesRemovedEvent`, `NewAssigneesRemovedEvent` | `assignees` (`[]UserInfo`) | dynamic assignees removed |
| `EventTypeTaskDeadlineWarning` | `approval.task.deadline_warning` | `TaskDeadlineWarningEvent`, `NewTaskDeadlineWarningEvent` | `assignee` (`UserInfo`), `deadline`, `hoursLeft` | pre-warning scanner flagged an approaching deadline |
| `EventTypeTaskUrged` | `approval.task.urged` | `TaskUrgedEvent`, `NewTaskUrgedEvent` | `urger` (`UserInfo`), `target` (`UserInfo`), `message` | the applicant or a current/former task holder (assignee or delegator) urged an assignee |

CC + Flow:

| Type constant | Topic | Payload / constructor | Payload fields beyond common fields | When |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `EventTypeCCNotified` | `approval.cc.notified` | `CCNotifiedEvent`, `NewCCNotifiedEvent` | `nodeId`, `nodeName`, `recipients` (`[]UserInfo`), `isManual` | a CC node or manual CC action delivered notifications |
| `EventTypeFlowCreated` | `approval.flow.created` | `FlowCreatedEvent`, `NewFlowCreatedEvent` | `categoryId` | flow created |
| `EventTypeFlowUpdated` | `approval.flow.updated` | `FlowUpdatedEvent`, `NewFlowUpdatedEvent` | none | flow updated |
| `EventTypeFlowDeployed` | `approval.flow.deployed` | `FlowDeployedEvent`, `NewFlowDeployedEvent` | `versionId`, `version` | flow version deployed |
| `EventTypeFlowToggled` | `approval.flow.toggled` | `FlowToggledEvent`, `NewFlowToggledEvent` | `isActive` | flow active flag changed |
| `EventTypeFlowPublished` | `approval.flow.published` | `FlowPublishedEvent`, `NewFlowPublishedEvent` | `versionId` | flow version published |

Every instance and task event carries `tenantId` and `occurredTime` from
`InstanceEventBase`; `occurredTime` is the business time projected onto
`Envelope.OccurredAt` by `event.WithOccurredAt`. `EventTypeTaskCreated` is the
catalog constant for the `approval.task.created` topic.

## Caller Context and Multi-Tenant Safety

Resource and command handlers resolve a `CallerContext` per request that bundles the tenant authority of the call. Exactly one of `TenantID`, `IsSuperAdmin`, or `IsSystemInternal` must be set; a zero `CallerContext` is fail-closed (treated as unauthorized).

| Member | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `TenantID` | the tenant this caller acts within; all reads/writes get filtered by it |
| `IsSuperAdmin` | the principal carries `approval:super_admin`; cross-tenant queries allowed |
| `IsSystemInternal` | the call originates from framework-internal code (scanners, listeners) |

Cross-tenant attempts return `approval.ErrCrossTenantAccess`. `IsSuperAdmin(p)` reports whether a principal carries the override role. The override role itself is exposed as `approval.SuperAdminRole` (`"approval:super_admin"`) for host wiring.

## Lifecycle Extension Points

| Extension point | Phase | Failure semantics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `approval.InstanceLifecycleHook` (FX group `vef:approval:lifecycle_hooks`) | synchronous, inside the engine transaction — instance creation and every status transition | returning an error rolls back the surrounding command |
| `approval.BusinessRefProvider` | synchronous, inside the start-instance transaction | returning an error rolls back instance creation |
| `approval.BusinessRefResolver` | synchronous, at claim time inside the start-instance transaction | returning an error rolls back instance creation |
| `approval.SubscribeInstance` (`event.SubscribeTyped` wrapper) | asynchronous, after the transaction commits | the bus retries via the outbox relay; consumers must be idempotent |
| `approval.BindCommand` (instance event → CQRS command bridge) | asynchronous, after the transaction commits | redelivery re-dispatches the command; the command handler must be idempotent |

### `InstanceLifecycleHook`

```go
type InstanceLifecycleHook interface {
    OnInstanceCreated(ctx context.Context, db orm.DB, instance *Instance) error
    OnInstanceTransition(ctx context.Context, db orm.DB, instance *Instance, from, to InstanceStatus) error
}
```

The hook is transition-generic — there is no completion-only variant. `OnInstanceTransition(instance, from, to)` runs inside the same transaction as **every** instance status transition — completion (`to.IsFinal()`), return, withdrawal, resubmission, termination. It runs after the engine-owned business projection has recorded (and, in synchronous mode, applied) the new state, so the hook observes the business table as the transition leaves it; `instance.Status` already carries `to`. Returning an error rolls back the whole transition.

Use lifecycle hooks for invariants that must hold inside the transaction (e.g. allocating a tightly-coupled business row). Use event subscriptions (or `BindCommand`, below) for everything else. Register hooks with `vef.ProvideApprovalLifecycleHook(constructor)` — the constructor must return `approval.InstanceLifecycleHook`, and multiple hooks compose via the `vef:approval:lifecycle_hooks` group. The invocation order across hooks is **unspecified** (FX value groups carry no ordering), so hooks must be mutually independent; any non-nil error stops the remaining hooks. `approval.NewFilteredLifecycleHook(hook, filters...)` wraps a hook with the same `InstanceFilter` vocabulary used by `SubscribeInstance` (below), so a hook can be scoped to specific flow codes or tenants without hand-written predicates.

### `BusinessRefProvider` and `BusinessRefResolver`

```go
type BusinessRefProvider interface {
    OnInstanceCreated(ctx context.Context, db orm.DB, flow *Flow, instance *Instance) (businessRef string, err error)
}

type BusinessRefResolver interface {
    ResolveRecordKey(ctx context.Context, flow *Flow, businessRef string) (BusinessRecordKey, error)
}
```

`BusinessRefProvider` supplies or allocates the opaque `Instance.BusinessRef` when `Flow.BindingMode == BindingBusiness`; inject it with `vef.SupplyBusinessRefProvider`. At instance start the engine resolves the ref into an `approval.BusinessRecordKey` — a map from every configured `KeyColumns` entry to its value — through `BusinessRefResolver`. The default resolver treats a single-column ref verbatim and decodes a multi-column ref from a JSON object; register a replacement with `vef.SupplyBusinessRefResolver` when `BusinessRef` uses another shape (business number, encoded tuple, …) or resolving the key requires a host lookup. A ref that cannot be resolved fails instance creation with `ErrInvalidBusinessRef` (code `40109`); a business-bound flow started without a ref fails with `ErrBusinessRefRequired` (code `40107`).

### Business-State Projection

Business write-back is a durable desired-state projection, not a per-trigger write-back. A business-bound flow configures one `BusinessBinding` document — `approval.BusinessBindingConfig`, stored as jsonb on `apv_flow` and snapshotted immutably onto each deployed `apv_flow_version`; runtime instances only ever read the version snapshot:

| Field | JSON | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TableName` | `tableName` | business table receiving approval state |
| `KeyColumns` | `keyColumns` | record key columns; must exactly match a non-null primary or unique key on the table (verified against the live schema at save time — missing table → `ErrBindingTableMissing`; missing column → `ErrBindingColumnMissing`; both surface as code `40018` / `ErrBindingSchemaInvalid`; non-unique key → `ErrBindingKeyNotUnique`) |
| `StatusColumn` | `statusColumn` | column receiving the (mapped) instance status |
| `InstanceIDColumn` | `instanceIdColumn` | **mandatory** — the compare-and-set fence that stops a stale instance from overwriting state owned by a newer approval round |
| `StartedAtColumn` | `startedAtColumn` | optional; receives the instance start time |
| `FinishedAtColumn` | `finishedAtColumn` | optional; receives the finish time for final statuses, `NULL` otherwise |
| `StatusMapping` | `statusMapping` | optional `InstanceStatus` → host status value map; missing entries fall back to the raw status string (`ErrBindingStatusMappingInvalid` rejects unknown statuses and blank values) |

Convergence works in three steps:

1. **Claim at start.** Inside the `start_instance` transaction the engine resolves the record key and claims one durable projection row per physical target (`apv_business_projection`, unique per table + record key). A non-final instance already owning the target blocks the claim with `ErrBindingTargetBusy` (code `40108`); a final owner is superseded, and the previously applied owner is retained as the business-table CAS fence until the new desired state is actually written. The instance links to its claim via `Instance.BusinessProjectionID`.
2. **Desired state per transition.** Every instance status transition bumps the projection's `DesiredRevision` and records the full desired state (status, started-at, finished-at). The projection converges on the *latest* desired state — intermediate statuses may be skipped, which is exactly why side effects tied to a specific lifecycle moment belong in `BindCommand` or `SubscribeInstance` instead.
3. **Apply.** `vef.approval.business_binding.consistency` selects when the business row is written:
   - `synchronous` (default) — inside the approval transaction; a write failure rolls the approval action back.
   - `eventual` — the approval action commits immediately; a background worker (`scan_interval`, default `10s`; `batch_size`, default `100`) claims due projections with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` plus a lease and applies the latest revision, retrying failures with exponential backoff (`1s << attemptCount`, i.e. 2s, 4s, …, capped at 1 hour). Each failed attempt publishes `InstanceBindingFailedEvent` as an operator notification — the durable projection row, not the event, drives the retry.

The applied `UPDATE` sets the configured columns `WHERE <key columns match> [AND <instanceIdColumn> = <applied owner>]`, translating the status through `StatusMapping`. Operators inspect and force convergence through the admin operations `find_business_projections` / `retry_business_projection` (see [RPC Resources](./resources.md#approvaladmin) — each projection row identifies its physical target via `BusinessTable` and `recordKey`), and `get_metrics` reports `businessProjectionCounts` and `pendingBusinessProjections`.

The projection status enum is `BindingProjectionStatus`. Its values are
`BindingProjectionPending` (a new desired state is recorded), `BindingProjectionProcessing`
(the worker has claimed the projection and is applying it), `BindingProjectionApplied`
(the latest desired state has been written), and `BindingProjectionFailed` (the last
write attempt failed and will be retried).

The engine owns this projection; it is configuration-driven and not replaced by an extension hook. Hosts add behavior around it with lifecycle hooks, event subscriptions, and command bridges.

### Host Subscriptions: `SubscribeInstance`

```go
func SubscribeInstance[T InstanceEvent](
    bus event.Bus,
    handler func(ctx context.Context, evt T, env event.Envelope) error,
    opts ...InstanceSubscribeOption,
) (event.Unsubscribe, error)
```

`SubscribeInstance` is the declarative wrapper over `event.SubscribeTyped` for instance events (any event type embedding `InstanceEventBase`, e.g. `InstanceCompletedEvent`). Routing filters are data, not predicates: `InstanceSubscribeOption` accepts `approval.ForFlows(codes...)` / `approval.ForTenants(ids...)` (`InstanceFilter` values), each OR-ing within its own dimension and AND-ing across filters passed to the same call; events that fail a filter are acknowledged without invoking the handler. Business predicates (final status, form values) belong in the handler body, not in filters.

The handler also receives the delivery `event.Envelope`: `Envelope.ID` is the Inbox dedupe key, stable across redeliveries, and therefore the key to build manual idempotency on when the route is at-least-once.

```go
vef.Invoke(func(bus event.Bus) error {
    _, err := approval.SubscribeInstance(bus,
        func(ctx context.Context, evt *approval.InstanceCompletedEvent, env event.Envelope) error {
            // idempotent side effect; env.ID is stable across redeliveries
            return nil
        },
        approval.ForFlows("leave_request"),
        approval.WithGroup("app:leave-writeback"),
    )
    return err
})
```

The consumer group defaults to one derived from the handler's method identity (`vef:sub:<module-relative pkg>.<Type>.<method>`, mirroring the `vef:default:<uuid>` shape used elsewhere). Anonymous handlers fail with `ErrAnonymousSubscriberGroup` unless `approval.WithGroup(name)` is given; a duplicate derived group registered twice in one process fails with `ErrDerivedGroupConflict`. **Renaming or moving a handler changes its derived group** (a new consumer group starts and the old one is orphaned) — pin the group with `WithGroup` before such refactors. `approval.WithConcurrency(n)` sets the per-subscription worker count.

### Command Bridge: `BindCommand`

```go
func BindCommand[E InstanceEvent, C cqrs.Action](
    bus event.Bus,
    commands cqrs.Bus,
    mapper func(evt E, env event.Envelope) (cmd C, ok bool),
    opts ...InstanceSubscribeOption,
) (event.Unsubscribe, error)
```

`BindCommand` subscribes to instance event `E` and dispatches the mapped command `C` through the host's CQRS bus — the declarative bridge from approval facts to host side effects. `mapper` is a pure translation: it shapes the command from the event plus its delivery envelope and reports relevance (`ok=false` acknowledges without dispatching). Business logic belongs in the command handler, which runs the host's full behavior pipeline (transaction, audit, validation); the handler's result is discarded — dispatch is fire-and-record.

```go
vef.Invoke(func(bus event.Bus, commands cqrs.Bus) error {
    _, err := approval.BindCommand(bus, commands,
        func(evt *approval.InstanceCompletedEvent, env event.Envelope) (app.SettleOrderCmd, bool) {
            if evt.FinalStatus != approval.InstanceApproved {
                return app.SettleOrderCmd{}, false
            }
            return app.SettleOrderCmd{InstanceID: evt.InstanceID, DedupeKey: env.ID}, true
        },
        approval.ForFlows("order_settlement"),
    )
    return err
})
```

The consumer group defaults to the command type's identity (`vef:cmd:<module-relative pkg>.<Type>`) — renaming or moving the command deliberately re-keys the subscription, exactly like renaming a `SubscribeInstance` handler; pin with `approval.WithGroup` ahead of such refactors. Binding the same command type twice in one process fails with `ErrDerivedGroupConflict`. Two guards reject invalid bindings up front: `ErrNonCommandAction` (the bound action type is a query) and `ErrUnnamedCommandType` (anonymous struct or interface-typed `C`). Filters and `WithConcurrency` apply as in `SubscribeInstance`.

Delivery inherits the event route's semantics: on an at-least-once transport the command handler must be idempotent — copy `Envelope.ID` into the command when it needs its own dedupe key. Unlike the eventual business projection — which converges on the latest desired state and may skip intermediate statuses — every instance transition dispatches its own command, making `BindCommand` the lane for side effects tied to a specific lifecycle moment.

## Business Identifier Validation

`Flow.BindingMode == BindingBusiness` flows carry SQL identifiers (`BusinessBindingConfig.TableName`, every `KeyColumns` entry, `StatusColumn`, `InstanceIDColumn`, and the optional timestamp columns) that the engine-owned projection interpolates directly into an `UPDATE` template. To prevent SQL injection, the framework whitelists identifiers against `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]{0,62}$`:

```go
if err := approval.ValidateBusinessIdentifier(table); err != nil {
    return err
}
```

Empty / whitespace-only strings pass — the caller decides whether absence itself is an error. Anything outside the whitelist returns `approval.ErrInvalidBusinessIdentifier`. Admin-side Flow CRUD should bubble this up so operators see meaningful errors.

## Delegation

Users can delegate their approval authority to others:

```go
type Delegation struct {
    DelegatorID    string         // Who delegates
    DelegateeID    string         // Who receives delegation
    FlowCategoryID *string        // Optional: limit to category
    FlowID         *string        // Optional: limit to specific flow
    StartsAt       timex.DateTime // Delegation window start
    EndsAt         timex.DateTime // Delegation window end
    IsActive       bool
    Reason         *string        // Optional: why the delegation exists
}
```
