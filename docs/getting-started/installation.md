# Installation

This page covers the minimum environment and project setup required to boot a VEF application.

## Requirements

The current framework version requires:

- Go `1.26.4`

The framework builds with `CGO_ENABLED=0`: the built-in expression engine uses
the pure-Go `expr-lang` library, and every built-in database driver is pure Go
as well. Enable CGO only when you add a native dependency of your own.

## Runtime prerequisites

If you use the default `vef.Run(...)` boot path, the current framework runtime always boots the database module.

That means the true minimum startup prerequisite is:

- a reachable database
- a valid `application.toml`

The default boot graph also includes the Redis module, but Redis only becomes a practical prerequisite when your application or an enabled feature actually consumes `*redis.Client` or another Redis-backed capability.

For the smallest local setup, use SQLite.

## Add the framework

Install the package in your Go module:

```bash
go get github.com/coldsmirk/vef-framework-go
```

If you are starting from an empty directory:

```bash
go mod init example.com/my-app
go get github.com/coldsmirk/vef-framework-go
```

## Pick a database early

VEF boots its database module during startup, so your application configuration needs a valid data source from the start. The framework supports:

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- SQLite
- SQL Server
- Oracle

For local exploration and small demos, SQLite is the simplest choice because it avoids external infrastructure.

## Add Redis only when needed

If you later enable Redis-backed features, the default client settings are:

- host: `127.0.0.1`
- port: `6379`
- network: `tcp`

One easy local option is:

```bash
docker run --name vef-redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis:7-alpine
```

## Create the config file

By default VEF looks for `application.toml` in:

- `./configs`
- `$VEF_CONFIG_PATH`
- `.`
- `../configs`

The most common layout is:

```text
my-app/
├── configs/
│   └── application.toml
└── main.go
```

## Minimal configuration

This is the smallest configuration that boots — SQLite, the default in-memory
storage provider, and the outbox event transport the storage module requires:

```toml
[vef.app]
name = "my-app"
port = 8080

[vef.data_sources.primary]
type = "sqlite"

[vef.event.transports.outbox]
enabled = true

[[vef.event.routing]]
pattern    = "vef.storage.*"
transports = ["outbox", "memory"]
```

The `primary` data source is mandatory. It powers the framework-wide `orm.DB`
injection; additional named data sources live under the same `vef.data_sources`
map.

The two event blocks are not optional decoration: the storage module publishes
its domain events transactionally and **fails startup** when no transactional
route serves `vef.storage.*` (the default `memory` transport is not
transactional). The route lists `"memory"` — the outbox's default sink
(`vef.event.transports.outbox.sink`) — alongside `"outbox"` so in-process
subscribers can attach to it; an outbox-only route publishes but rejects every
subscription. Setting `vef.event.default_transport = "outbox"` is the
routing-rule-free alternative. See [Quick Start](./quick-start) for the
walkthrough of this exact failure.

If you omit `vef.storage.provider`, the framework falls back to memory storage.
Add `vef.redis` only when the application really uses Redis-backed features.

## What happens during startup

When you call `vef.Run(...)`, the framework initializes configuration, the data
source registry and primary `orm.DB`, middleware, API routing, security, events
(plus the tx_memory / outbox / redis-stream / inbox transport submodules), the expression
engine, the JS engine, CQRS, cron, Redis, distributed locks, mold, storage,
sequence, schema, monitoring, MCP, server push, and finally the HTTP
application.

That is why installation in VEF is not just “import the package”. A valid config file is part of installation.

## Optional environment variables

The framework reads exactly three environment variables; all are useful during
setup:

- `VEF_CONFIG_PATH`: add an extra config search directory
- `VEF_LOG_LEVEL`: adjust log verbosity
- `VEF_I18N_LANGUAGE`: switch the framework language, defaulting to Simplified Chinese

## Next step

Continue to [Quick Start](./quick-start) to build a minimal resource and confirm the app is serving requests.
