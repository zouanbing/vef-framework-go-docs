# Data Permissions

VEF supports request-scoped data permissions so that authorization can narrow the rows a user may read or mutate, not just whether the endpoint is callable at all.

## The Main Pieces

The data-permission system revolves around:

- `security.DataPermissionResolver`
- `security.DataScope`
- `security.DataPermissionApplier`

Minimal scope example:

```go
scope := security.NewSelfDataScope(orm.ColumnCreatedBy)
```

During request processing, the API middleware asks the resolver for the current principal's data scope for the current permission token. It then stores a request-scoped applier in context.

## How CRUD Uses It

Many CRUD operations can automatically apply data-permission filtering:

- read operations apply it while building queries
- update/delete operations apply it before mutating records

That means handlers often do not need to know the details of row-level permission enforcement.

In practice, automatic filtering still depends on your application providing a working data-permission source. If the default RBAC resolver has no usable permission loader behind it, there may be no scope to apply. When an operation requires a permission token, a missing resolver or a resolver error fails the request with HTTP 403; a nil scope (no matching permission) simply skips filtering.

If you rely on the default RBAC data-permission resolver, treat `security.RolePermissionsLoader` as the practical prerequisite for meaningful row-level filtering.

## Disabling Automatic Data Permission

All find, update, and delete CRUD builders (including batch variants) expose `DisableDataPerm()` for cases where automatic filtering is not appropriate. Create operations have no query to filter, so they do not offer it.

Use it carefully. If you disable data permission on a privileged endpoint, you are taking responsibility for enforcing the correct data boundary elsewhere.

## Why This Matters

Regular authorization answers:

> can this principal call this operation?

Data permission answers:

> which records can this principal touch once the operation is allowed?

These are different layers, and VEF keeps them distinct.

## Typical Use Cases

Examples of data scopes include:

- all rows for a system admin
- only self-created records
- department-scoped access
- tenant-scoped filtering

The built-in `SelfDataScope` is the smallest example of this pattern. Broader organization- or department-based scopes are usually application-defined.

The exact policy is application-owned through the resolver and scope implementation.

Built-in data scopes use these exact keys and defaults:

| Scope | `Key()` | `Priority()` | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AllDataScope` | `all` | `PriorityAll` (`10000`) | supports every table and does not modify the query |
| `SelfDataScope` | `self` | `PrioritySelf` (`10`) | supports tables that have the creator column and adds an equality filter for the current principal ID |

`NewSelfDataScope("")` defaults the creator column to `created_by`
(`orm.ColumnCreatedBy`). `SelfDataScope.Supports(...)` returns false when the
target table does not expose that column, so no filter is applied for that
table.

The priority constants are `PrioritySelf` (`10`), `PriorityDepartment` (`20`),
`PriorityDepartmentAndSub` (`30`), `PriorityOrganization` (`40`),
`PriorityOrganizationAndSub` (`50`), `PriorityCustom` (`60`), and
`PriorityAll` (`10000`). The default RBAC data-permission resolver chooses the
highest numeric priority when multiple role scopes match the same permission.

`RequestScopedDataPermApplier.Apply(...)` has explicit skip and error paths:

| Condition | Result |
| --- | --- |
| no `DataScope` is configured | skip without error |
| query does not implement `orm.QueryBuilder` | `ErrQueryNotQueryBuilder` |
| query builder has no model/table | `ErrQueryModelNotSet` |
| `DataScope.Supports(...)` returns false | skip without error |
| `DataScope.Apply(...)` returns an error | wraps the scope key in the returned error |

## Public Data-Permission APIs

| API group | Public surface |
| --- | --- |
| scopes | `DataScope`, `AllDataScope`, `SelfDataScope`, `NewAllDataScope`, `NewSelfDataScope` |
| scope priorities | `PrioritySelf`, `PriorityDepartment`, `PriorityDepartmentAndSub`, `PriorityOrganization`, `PriorityOrganizationAndSub`, `PriorityCustom`, `PriorityAll` |
| resolver dependency | `RolePermissionsLoader` |
| request applier | `DataPermissionResolver`, `DataPermissionApplier`, `RequestScopedDataPermApplier`, `NewRequestScopedDataPermApplier` |
| departments | `DepartmentLoader`, `DepartmentOption`, `DepartmentSelector`, `DepartmentSelectionChallengeData`, `DepartmentSelectionChallengeProvider` |
| diagnostics | `ErrQueryNotQueryBuilder`, `ErrQueryModelNotSet` |

## Practical Advice

- keep data scope rules outside handlers
- let CRUD apply row filters whenever possible
- use `DisableDataPerm()` only when you can clearly justify the alternative

## Next Step

Move to [Infrastructure](../infrastructure/cache) or [Transactions](../data-access/transactions) depending on whether you want platform capabilities or deeper runtime extension points next.
