# Parameters And Metadata

VEF separates request input into two sections:

- `params`: business input
- `meta`: request-level control data

That split exists for RPC requests and is preserved internally for REST requests as well.

## Request Model Overview

| Section | Purpose | Typical content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `params` | business payload | search fields, write payloads, uploaded files, command inputs |
| `meta` | request controls | paging, sorting, export format, option column mapping |

## Supported Typed Targets

The framework supports these request-decoding targets:

| Target type | Decoded from | Validation | Typical use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| typed struct embedding `api.P` | `params` | Yes | business params |
| typed struct embedding `api.M` | `meta` | Yes | typed meta |
| `page.Pageable` | `meta` | Yes | paging |
| `api.Params` | `params` | No typed validation | raw dynamic payload |
| `api.Meta` | `meta` | No typed validation | raw dynamic meta |

## Permissive Params Decoding

Params decoding is permissive by default: a request key the target struct does
not declare is ignored, so a client that is still sending a retired field keeps
working. The framework does not reject the request for an unknown key;
`Params.Decode` simply drops it.

To surface those unknown keys for monitoring, use `Params.DecodeReportingUnmapped`:

```go
unmapped, err := params.DecodeReportingUnmapped(&target)
```

It returns the sorted list of request keys the target struct does not declare.
Nested keys are reported by path (for example, `trigger.at`). The framework's
request pipeline logs them once per operation and key set, which keeps a
misspelled or retired field visible without failing a request older clients
still send.

There is no strict/reject mode: a closed contract is expressed by the report,
not by a `400`.

## `api.P` Marks Params Structs

Embed `api.P` in structs that should decode from `Request.Params`:

```go
type CreateUserParams struct {
	api.P

	Username string `json:"username" validate:"required"`
	Email    string `json:"email" validate:"required,email"`
}
```

When a handler accepts `CreateUserParams` or `*CreateUserParams`, the framework:

1. decodes `params`
2. validates the struct
3. injects the typed value

## `api.M` Marks Meta Structs

Embed `api.M` in structs that should decode from `Request.Meta`:

```go
type PageMeta struct {
	api.M
	page.Pageable
}
```

This is how typed request controls are injected.

## Built-In Meta Helpers

The framework has built-in support for these meta-oriented helper types:

| Type | Meaning | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `page.Pageable` | page number and page size | directly recognized as a built-in meta type |
| `crud.Sortable` | sort specs | usually embedded inside a typed meta struct |

Important distinction:

- `page.Pageable` is the only entry in the built-in meta type list
- `crud.Sortable` is not on that list, but since it embeds `api.M` itself it
  still resolves as a standalone handler parameter through the embedded-`M`
  path — and it works naturally when embedded in your own typed meta struct

## Raw Access

If you do not want typed decoding, handlers can accept:

| Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `api.Params` | raw params map |
| `api.Meta` | raw meta map |

Use raw access for dynamic, proxy-style, or partially unknown payloads. Prefer typed structs for stable business APIs.

## RPC Decoding Rules

For RPC requests, decoding depends on the transport content type:

| RPC request type | `params` source | `meta` source | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| JSON body | request JSON `params` object | request JSON `meta` object | standard RPC shape |
| form request | form field `params` parsed as JSON string | form field `meta` parsed as JSON string | used for form-style clients |
| multipart form | form field `params` parsed as JSON string, plus uploaded files merged into params | form field `meta` parsed as JSON string | file fields are added into params |

## REST Decoding Rules

For REST requests:

| Input source | Lands in | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| route path parameters | `params` | path placeholders from the operation's route pattern (for example `:id`) |
| query string | `params` | used for read filters and plain request fields |
| JSON body on `POST` / `PUT` / `PATCH` | `params` | write payload |
| multipart fields on `POST` / `PUT` / `PATCH` | `params` | includes uploaded files |
| `X-Meta-*` headers | `meta` | request-level control values; keys are lowercased after the prefix is removed |

The router strips the reserved query parameter `security.QueryKeyAccessToken` (`__accessToken`) before filling `params` — authentication reads it directly from the request context, so it never enters the business parameter space.

That means paging and sorting are not automatically pulled from query string into built-in meta helpers. If a handler expects meta-based controls such as `page.Pageable`, the caller should provide them through `X-Meta-*` headers or a typed meta contract.

## Numeric Fidelity

JSON payloads for `params` and `meta` are parsed with number preservation
(`json.Decoder.UseNumber`), so numeric values keep their exact digits instead
of collapsing to `float64` at the parse step:

- **Typed numeric fields** (`int64`, `uint32`, `float64`, …) get an exact
  digit parse. A fractional or exponent-form number targeting an integer
  field fails with `mapx.ErrJSONNumberNotInteger`; a value that does not fit
  the target type fails with `mapx.ErrJSONNumberOverflow` — mirroring
  `encoding/json` strictness instead of silently truncating.
- **`json.RawMessage` captures** see the original literal with full
  precision — large IDs and high-precision decimals survive a round trip
  through `api.Params` unchanged.
- **Untyped targets** (`any` / `map[string]any` / `[]any`) still receive
  `float64`, preserving the long-standing runtime contract for dynamic
  handlers — `json.Number` never leaks into decoded results.

No handler code changes are needed; the difference is visible only where
precision used to be lost (int64 IDs above 2^53, decimal amounts) or where
out-of-range numbers used to be accepted silently.

## Multipart File Support

Multipart uploads can populate params fields such as:

| Shape | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `*multipart.FileHeader` | standard single-file upload field |
| raw file entries inside `api.Params` | useful for proxy-style or dynamic handlers |

This is how built-in storage and import endpoints receive uploaded files.

## Validation Behavior

Typed params and typed meta values are automatically validated after decoding.
`Params.Decode` and `Meta.Decode` require the target to be a pointer to a
struct; non-struct or non-pointer targets fail before validation.

| Target type | Validation |
| --- | --- |
| typed `api.P` struct | yes |
| typed `api.M` struct | yes |
| `page.Pageable` | yes |
| `api.Params` | no typed validation |
| `api.Meta` | no typed validation |

Validation uses `validator.Validate(...)` after decoding. If validation fails, the framework returns a bad-request style result with translated field messages.

## Practical Patterns

### Standard search request

```go
type UserSearch struct {
	api.P
	Keyword string `json:"keyword" search:"contains,column=username|email"`
}

type UserMeta struct {
	api.M
	page.Pageable
	crud.Sortable
}
```

### Dynamic proxy-style request

```go
func (*ProxyResource) Forward(params api.Params, meta api.Meta) error {
	// handle raw data
	return nil
}
```

## Practical Advice

- put business fields in `params`
- put paging, sorting, export mode, and similar request controls in `meta`
- prefer typed structs over raw maps for long-term maintainability
- embed `api.P` and `api.M` explicitly so decoding intent stays obvious
- use raw `api.Params` / `api.Meta` only when the request contract is truly dynamic
